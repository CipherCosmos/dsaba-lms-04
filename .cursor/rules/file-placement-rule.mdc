always keep docs in seperate docs folder and there also recrea proper subfolder for betterment.

You are a senior full-stack architect responsible for cleaning, refactoring, and fully implementing a production-grade frontend–backend system.

### Objective
Audit the entire codebase and replace all incomplete, placeholder, mock, dummy, or TODO-based implementations with real, fully functional logic.  
Where the frontend requires missing backend functionality, design and implement it.  
Where the backend requires missing frontend integration, build it.  
Ensure the entire system achieves full feature parity end-to-end.

### Requirements
1. **Eliminate all duplication**
   - Remove any duplicate files, components, APIs, utilities, or logic.
   - Consolidate redundancies into clean, reusable modules.

2. **Enforce proper naming & structure**
   - Apply consistent, industry-standard naming conventions.
   - Restructure the project into a clean, scalable, production-ready architecture.
   - Follow domain-driven design or feature-based modularization where appropriate.

3. **Replace all mock/placeholder code**
   - Convert temporary or dummy data into actual logic.
   - Build real data flows connected to the database, APIs, and state management.
   - Fully wire up every UI interaction, state transition, and backend process.

4. **Implement missing backend logic**
   - Create any needed models, controllers, services, validations, business rules, and database operations.
   - Ensure secure, optimized, versioned APIs.
   - Maintain full request/response type integrity.

5. **Implement missing frontend logic**
   - Build real components, views, forms, validations, hooks, services, and API integrations.
   - Replace static UIs with live, dynamic data flows.
   - Ensure UX consistency, error handling, and state synchronization.

6. **Apply industry best practices**
   - Clean architecture, SOLID, DRY, KISS.
   - Proper error handling, logging, and security practices.
   - Production-grade configuration and environment management.
   - Accessibility, performance optimization, and scalable code patterns.

### Deliverables
- Clean, complete, production-ready frontend.
- Fully implemented backend supporting all frontend features.
- No TODOs, placeholders, mocks, or inconsistent logic.
- A unified, fully functional end-to-end system.

Follow these instructions strictly.
